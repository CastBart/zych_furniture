online furniture store

I am using FakeStoreAPI for this project.
1. It allows me to pull products from the API
2. Create users
3. Create carts and update them
4. Update products 

A project focused on creating an online furniture store. The goal for this project is to leanr more about 3rd party APIs.
I will use a free store API to dump data onto the screen. It is a way for me to learn REST APIs to familiarise myself for 
real world applications.
