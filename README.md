online furniture store
 
 
 I am using firebase in this project for storing information in a database and images in the storage.
 I am then retrieving all the information from the database. I am duoing so as I will find it easier
 to make any updates to the page. All I aim to do in the future is change images in the storage or 
 change information in the database rather than going throug the whole process of building the app 
 and changing all files on the hosting service.
 
 The website is developed using react and some other react-compatible libraries.I am using 
 React-Bootstrap as my main styling for this page and will be using AWS as my hosting services.
